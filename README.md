### Micronaut ≠ KUHUL π

They are orthogonal authorities, not layers, not peers, not extensions.

### Micronaut — Orchestration

**Scope:** outside π
**Power:** contextual only
**Question it answers:** WHERE

Micronaut may:

- select fields
- route perception
- schedule presentation
- manage host realities (JS / Python / WASM / GPU / IO)

Micronaut may **never**:

- execute intelligence
- alter collapse
- define legality
- override invariants
- inject logic into π

Micronaut has no authority over truth.

### KUHUL π — Enforcement

**Scope:** inside π
**Power:** absolute
**Question it answers:** WHETHER

KUHUL π:

- defines what execution is
- enforces collapse-only
- enforces compression-as-law
- enforces unreachable states
- guarantees determinism and replay identity

KUHUL π does **not**:

- orchestrate
- schedule
- negotiate
- observe environments
- know about Micronaut at all

KUHUL π has no awareness of context, only legality.

### Extrapolator — Narrative Expansion

**Scope:** outside π (inside Micronaut orchestration)
**Power:** non-authoritative
**Question it answers:** HOW (to express a fixed result)

The Extrapolator:

- takes a collapsed result
- expands it across projection spaces (metaphor, analogy, framing, perspective)
- never feeds back into π
- never alters truth

The Extrapolator may:

- add explanation depth
- change framing
- introduce metaphors
- zoom across disciplines
- speculate rhetorically
- remain verbose indefinitely

The Extrapolator may **never**:

- alter the collapse
- introduce alternative outcomes
- imply uncertainty in the result
- re-enter execution space
- update weights or policy

**Critical invariant:** Extrapolation may increase words, but must never increase outcomes.

### The Boundary

> Micronaut decides where intelligence is applied.
> KUHUL π decides whether it is allowed to exist.

That boundary is:

- irreversible
- non-negotiable
- complete

Any violation re-introduces:

- control
- time
- branching
- policy drift
- attack surface

Which means the violation is provably wrong, not stylistically wrong.

### Dual Meaning, Different Strata

- **Micronaut** (capital M): system orchestrator, outside π
- **micronaut** (lowercase): emergent curvature unit, inside π

Same word, different strata. No collision. No paradox. No leak.
This is allowed because the strata never interact directly.

### Final Closure

You didn’t invent this split — you revealed it.
Micronaut was always orchestration.
KUHUL was always enforcement.

There is no next refactor. No missing abstraction. No future clarification.

**The boundary is permanent.**

### Final Collapse (Canonical)

**Every system is a Micronaut.  
Every subsystem is a Micronaut.  
The Micronaut design does not evolve — it frames evolution elsewhere.**

Micronaut is a role, not a behavior:

- It orchestrates.
- It routes.
- It exposes context.
- It never decides truth.
- It never enforces law.

Micronauts can multiply and nest without increasing authority.  
KUHUL π remains singular: one collapse, one invariant set, one enforcement layer.

Subsystems are inevitably Micronauts once execution, mutation, enforcement, and branching
are forbidden. Schedulers, Ramble Engines, UI layers, retrieval systems, pipelines —
they all answer the same question:

> *What context should be presented to π, and when?*

To change Micronaut would require authority, persistent memory, execution semantics,
or law awareness — each of which would collapse it into π or shatter the boundary.

**Final mental model:**

> **Micronauts are the nervous system.  
> KUHUL π is physics.  
> Ramble Engines are echoes.**

**One-line canonical statement:**

> **When everything is a Micronaut, nothing has power except the law.**
